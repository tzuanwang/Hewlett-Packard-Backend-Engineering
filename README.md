## Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
This repository contains the code for the Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program from Hewlett Packard. The program focused on various aspects of back-end engineering, including software architecture, refactoring, unit testing, and test-driven development.

## Tasks
* Task One: Propose for a RESTful web service to manage a list of employees
* Task Two: Build a basic web server application in Java Spring Boot that can accept and respond to HTTP requests
* Task Three: Build out application so that it supports uploading JSON data
* Task Four: Develop and run a set of unit tests to assess applicationâ€™s performance

## Skills Learned
Throughout this program, I acquired the following skills:
* Java Spring Boot: I built a web server application that accepts HTTP requests and wrote automated tests for the Java Spring Boot application using Mockito or JUnit frameworks.
* Software Architecture: I learned how to design clean and efficient architectures for messy components, ensuring scalability and maintainability. This involved analyzing the existing system, identifying areas for improvement, and proposing a well-structured design.
* Unit Testing: I became proficient in writing unit tests for the codebase, ensuring that individual components and functions work as expected. I learned how to use testing frameworks and techniques to verify the correctness of the code and identify potential bugs or regressions.
* Object-Oriented Programming(OOP): Contains code examples and implementations showcasing the application of OOP principles. It includes classes, inheritance, and other OOP concepts relevant to the back-end engineering domain.
* Test-Driven Development(TDD): I practiced the principles of TDD by writing tests before implementing new functionality. This approach helped me in designing clear requirements, improving code quality, and maintaining a robust test suite.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Hewlett Packard for providing this Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program, which has significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge in software architecture, refactoring, unit testing, and test-driven development.
